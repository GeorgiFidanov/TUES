You have 5 philosopher and 5 chopsticks, they are all seated around a round table.
Between each two philosophers there is one stick between them.
Each philosopher has his onw cycle of thinking,
then (after he is done) he will try to take a chopstick,
if he has two sticks he will be able to commit to the next activity,
which is eating, we're done he will release both of the sticks and will begin thing again.
One cycle of a philosopher is a thread.
Implement this task on Java for this multithreaded mutex problem.

+bonus task what will happen when all philosophers pick up at the same the left chopstick?
