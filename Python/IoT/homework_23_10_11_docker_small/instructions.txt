sudo docker build --tag hw1 . 
We log as admin then tell docker to create our image, which we name hw1,
 by using the instructions in the Dockerfile
 
sudo docker run -d -p 5000:5000 hw1
Again with admin permissions we start our container in detached mode (in the background).
 Then we pair the host port 5000 with container port 5000 for hw1.
